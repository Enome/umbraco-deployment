########################

Asp.net WebApp with a deployment batch and a file structure that can be source controlled. 

********WARNING********
#######################
The batch file uses /MIR which will try and mirror this webapp with your Umbraco instance. This means it will DELETE files that don't exists in the source directory. 

USAGE:
########################
-Run the init.bat
-This will create the Umbraco.Framework folder.
-Copy your Umbraco files into the Umbraco.Framework folder.
-It will also create a few empty folders in Umbraco.SourceFiles because GIT doesn't source control empty folders.
-The RobocopyThis.bat file gets called in the post build event.
-You can adjust it(it's not hard) to whatever you like.
